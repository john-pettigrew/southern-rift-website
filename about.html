				The show stopping duo out of Oklahoma City, Southern Rift is ready to take world by storm. The band is comprised of singer-songwriters Brooke Potter and Connor Anderson. Their unique take on country music draws influences from folk, indie, pop and bluegrass. Brooke and Connor's powerful vocals combine to create sweet harmonies and the addition of Connor's acoustics provides an unmatchable musical chemistry.</p>
	<p> Brooke has been performing since the age of 5 when she first belted out Britney Spear's "Oops I Did It Again" at her school's talent show. She got her start at the Rodeo Opry where she has performed numerous times and worked with artists such as Laura Leighe, Kata Hay and the Blaze, Amanda Earheart, Cindy Scarberry, and many more. Brooke has performed at music festivals and the Oklahoma State Fair multiple times. She has sung the national anthem all over Oklahoma, from sporting events, chambers of commerce, the Oklahoma Air National Guard, and at the 2009 Oklahoma Military Ball for several-esteemed guest including Governor Brad Henry.</p>
	<p> Choctaw native, Connor Anderson has had a love of performing at the age of 11 where he started out in musical theatre. After seeing Coldplay in concert at age 15, Connor Anderson became inspired to pick up guitar and hasn't put it down since. He sings with the Lifelight band at St. Lukes United Methodist Church in OKC as a part of the contemporary service. He's been featured on Rise and Shine Oklahoma and has had performances with the Rodeo Opry as well as many other theatres across Oklahoma. Some of his musical influences include John Mayer, Rob Thomas, Paul Simon, John Paul White and Ben Rector.</p>
